      This book is the fastest way to get up and running with Terraform, an open source tool that allows you to define
      your infrastructure as code using a simple, declarative programming language, and to deploy and manage that
      infrastructure across a variety of cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean).
    </p>
    <p class="justify thin">
      This is a hands-on-tutorial that not only teaches you DevOps and infrastructure as code principles, but also
      walks you through code examples that you can try at home. You'll go from deploying a basic "Hello, World"
      Terraform example all the way up to running a full tech stack (server cluster, load balancer, database) capable
      of supporting a large amount of traffic and a large team of developers&mdash;all in the span of just a few
      chapters.
    </p>
    <p class="justify thin">
      By the time you're done, you'll be ready to use Terraform in the real world.
